# A Polestar
Augmented Reality Project using LeapMotion for my final year University Advanced Group Project (http://www.glos.ac.uk/courses/pages/mapsanddescriptors.aspx?modulecode=ct6008)

"A pole star is a visible star, preferably a prominent one, that is approximately aligned with the Earth's axis of rotation" - As this part of the project is aimed at attracting people to the end-of-year showcase event COMX (http://comx.glos.ac.uk) I thought the project name was a suitable one.
